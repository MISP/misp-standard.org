# MISP Standard Committee Charter

## Introduction

The **MISP Standard Committee** is dedicated to the development, maintenance, and promotion of open standards for threat intelligence sharing. Operating under the auspices of [misp-standard.org](https://misp-standard.org), the committee ensures that all standards are relevant, up-to-date, and published as Internet-Drafts (I-D) through the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and MISP standard publication.

## Objectives

- **Accept New Standards**: Evaluate and approve proposals for new MISP standards that enhance threat intelligence sharing capabilities.
- **Update Existing Standards**: Regularly review and revise existing standards to address emerging cybersecurity challenges and technological advancements.
- **Publish as IETF Internet-Drafts**: Ensure all standards are documented and submitted as IETF I-Ds for broader community engagement and potential adoption as formal RFCs.

## Model of Operation

### Membership

- **Open Participation**: Membership is open to all individuals and organizations interested in contributing to MISP standards.
- **Diverse Representation**: Encourage participation from various sectors, including cybersecurity experts, industry professionals, academics, and government agencies.

### Meetings

- **Regular Sessions**: Conduct monthly virtual meetings to discuss proposals, updates, and committee activities.
- **Special Meetings**: Schedule additional meetings as needed for urgent matters or in-depth discussions.

### Proposal Submission

- **Documentation Requirements**: Proposals must include a detailed description, objectives, and any relevant technical specifications.

### Review and Approval

- **Initial Assessment**: A designated review team evaluates submissions for completeness and relevance.
- **Community Feedback**: Publish proposals for a 30-day public comment period to gather broader input.
- **Final Decision**: The committee votes on proposals after considering all feedback; a majority vote is required for approval.

### Publication

- **Draft Preparation**: Approved standards are formatted according to IETF guidelines for I-Ds.
- **MISP Standard Publication**: The standard is published on the MISP Standard website.
- **IETF Submission**: Submit the drafts to the IETF for official publication and initiate the standardization process.
- **Ongoing Maintenance**: Monitor and revise drafts based on MISP standard, IETF feedback and evolving community needs.

## Objectives

- **Streamline Standardization**: Maintain a simple, low-bureaucracy standardization process.
- **Ensure Open Accessibility**: Make standards openly accessible and readily reusable.
- **Enable Continuous Evolution**: Provide regular updates to standards in response to community needs.
