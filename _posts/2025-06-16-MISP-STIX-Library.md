We are pleased to announce the release of version [2025.6.12 of the MISP-STIX library](https://github.com/MISP/misp-stix/releases/tag/2025.6.12). This new release marks another step forward in our commitment to providing robust and comprehensive tools for the threat intelligence community along with open and freely accessible standards.

The MISP-STIX library is a cornerstone of the MISP project, and its continued development is vital for our users. Open-source libraries like misp-stix are essential for extending the functionality of the [MISP core format](https://www.misp-standard.org/rfc/misp-standard-core.html), allowing for seamless integration with other tools and standards. The library provides a critical bridge between the MISP and STIX formats, enabling exhaustive conversion between all revisions of the OASIS STIX standard. This flexibility is crucial for ensuring that threat intelligence can be shared and consumed across different platforms and environments, regardless of the specific format version being used.

One of the key strengths of the [MISP core format](https://www.misp-standard.org/rfc/misp-standard-core.html) is its stability. Over the past decade, the format has remained consistent, providing a reliable foundation for threat intelligence sharing and analysis. This stability is a testament to the design of the MISP project and our commitment to providing a long-term solution for the community. The MISP-STIX library builds on this foundation, offering a powerful and versatile tool for working with both MISP and STIX data.

We encourage all users to update to the latest version of the [MISP-STIX library](https://github.com/misp/misp-stix) to take advantage of the new features and improvements. As always, we welcome your feedback and contributions to the project.
