In order to preserve and foster the standard and its evolution, the MISP project spun off a new structure in 2019, with the aim to standardise the format under the misp-standard.org.

MISP standard is a collaborative intelligence standard, powering intelligence and information exchange, sharing and modeling. The misp-standard.org is a standard body developing free and open standards through sane open-source collaboration.
