                          MISP taxonomy format

Abstract

   This document describes the MISP taxonomy format which describes a
   simple JSON format to represent machine tags (also called triple
   tags) vocabularies.  A public directory of common vocabularies called
   MISP taxonomies is available and relies on the MISP taxonomy format.
   MISP taxonomies are used to classify cyber security events, threats,
   suspicious events, or indicators.

1.  Introduction

   Sharing threat information became a fundamental requirements on the
   Internet, security and intelligence community at large.  Threat
   information can include indicators of compromise, malicious file
   indicators, financial fraud indicators or even detailed information
   about a threat actor.  While sharing such indicators or information,
   classification plays an important role to ensure adequate
   distribution, understanding, validation or action of the shared
   information.  MISP taxonomies is a public repository of known
   vocabularies that can be used in threat information sharing.

   Machine tags were introduced in 2007 [machine-tags] to allow users to
   be more precise when tagging their pictures with geolocation.  So a
   machine tag is a tag which uses a special syntax to provide more
   information to users and machines.  Machine tags are also known as
   triple tags due to their format.

   In the MISP taxonomy context, machine tags help analysts to classify
   their cybersecurity events, indicators or threats.  MISP taxonomies
   can be used for classification, filtering, triggering actions or

   visualisation depending on their use in threat intelligence platforms
   such as MISP [MISP-P].

1.1.  Conventions and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Format

   A machine tag is composed of a namespace (MUST), a predicate (MUST)
   and an optional value (OPTIONAL).

   Machine tags are represented as a string.  Below listed are a set of
   sample machine tags for different namespaces such as tlp, admiralty-
   scale and osint.

   tlp:amber
   admiralty-scale:information-credibility="1"
   osint:source-type="blog-post"

   The MISP taxonomy format describes how to define a machine tag
   namespace in a parseable format.  The objective is to provide a
   simple format to describe machine tag (aka triple tag) vocabularies.

2.1.  Overview

   The MISP taxonomy format uses the JSON [RFC8259] format.  Each
   namespace is represented as a JSON object with meta information
   including the following fields: namespace, description, version,
   type.

   namespace defines the overall namespace of the machine tag.  The
   namespace is represented as a string and MUST be present.  The
   description is represented as a string and MUST be present.  A
   version is represented as a unsigned integer MUST be present.  A type
   defines where a specific taxonomy is applicable and a type can be
   applicable at event, user or org level.  The type is represented as
   an array containing one or more type and SHOULD be present.  If a
   type is not mentioned, by default, the taxonomy is applicable at
   event level only.  An exclusive boolean property MAY be present and
   defines at namespace level if the predicates are mutually exclusive.

   predicates defines all the predicates available in the namespace
   defined. predicates is represented as an array of JSON objects.
   predicates MUST be present and MUST at least content one element.

   values defines all the values for each predicate in the namespace
   defined. values SHOULD be present.

2.2.  predicates

   The predicates array contains one or more JSON objects which lists
   all the possible predicates.  The JSON object contains two fields:
   value and expanded. value MUST be present. expanded SHOULD be
   present. value is represented as a string and describes the predicate
   value.  The predicate value MUST not contain spaces or colons.
   expanded is represented as a string and describes the human-readable
   version of the predicate value.  An exclusive property MAY be present
   and defines at namespace level if the values are mutually exclusive.

2.3.  values

   The values array contain one or more JSON objects which lists all the
   possible values of a predicate.  The JSON object contains two fields:
   predicate and entry. predicate is represented as a string and
   describes the predicate value. entry is an array with one or more
   JSON objects.  The JSON object contains two fields: value and
   expanded. value MUST be present. expanded SHOULD be present. value is
   represented as a string and describes the machine parsable value.
   expanded is represented as a string and describes the human-readable
   version of the value.

2.4.  optional fields

2.4.1.  colour

   colour fields MAY be used at predicates or values level to set a
   specify colour that MAY be used by the implementation.  The colour
   field is described as an RGB colour fill in hexadecimal
   representation.

   Example use of the colour field in the Traffic Light Protocol (TLP):

   "predicates": [
       {
         "colour": "#CC0033",
         "expanded": "(TLP:RED) Information exclusively and directly
                      given to (a group of) individual recipients.
                      Sharing outside is not legitimate.",
         "value": "red"
       },
       {
         "colour": "#FFC000",
         "expanded": "(TLP:AMBER) Information exclusively given
                      to an organization; sharing limited within
                      the organization to be effectively acted upon.",
         "value": "amber"
       }...]

2.4.2.  description

   description fields MAY be used at predicates or values level to add a
   descriptive and human-readable information about the specific
   predicate or value.  The field is represented as a string.
   Implementations MAY use the description field to improve more
   contextual information.  The description at the namespace level is a
   MUST as described above.

2.4.3.  numerical_value

   numerical_value fields MAY be used at a predicate or value level to
   add a machine-readable numeric value to a specific predicate or
   value.  The field is represented as a JSON number.  Implementations
   SHOULD use the decimal value provided to support scoring or
   filtering.

   The decimal range for numerical_value SHOULD use a range from 0 up to
   100.  The range is recommended to support common mathematical
   properties among taxonomies.

   Example use of the numerical_value in the MISP confidence level:

        ]
        }

3.  Directory

   The MISP taxonomies directory is publicly available [MISP-T] in a git
   repository.  The repository contains a directory per namespace then a
   file machinetag.json which contains the taxonomy as described in the
   format above.  In the root of the repository, a MANIFEST.json exists
   containing a list of all the taxonomies.

   The MANIFEST.json file is composed of an JSON object with metadata
   like version, license, description, url and path.  A taxonomies array
   describes the taxonomy available with the description, name and
   version field.
