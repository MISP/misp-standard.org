MISP standard is a collaborative intelligence standard, powering intelligence and information exchange, sharing and modeling. The misp-standard.org is a standard body developing free and open standards through sane open-source collaboration.

# History

In 2012, a group of organisations joined forces in order to work on an open-source project, aiming to enable the exchange of cybersecurity information, called [MISP](https://www.misp-project.org/). Over the years,
the project grew larger and a wide range of organisations became both users of and contributors to the project.

In 2016, as part of an effort to enable interoperability and to support integrators, the team behind the open-source project began documenting the formats and protocols used by the MISP software, which lead to more users, contributors and organisations starting to rely on the MISP formats and protocols for information and intelligence exchange.

As of 2017, the MISP format was extended with an object templating system, introducing the ability for anyone to control their own custom data-models without depending on third-party validation or consensus.

In order to preserve and foster the standard and its evolution, the MISP project spun off a new structure in 2019, with the aim to standardise the format under the [misp-standard.org](https://www.misp-standard.org).

As of July 2019, [4 official standards](/standards) (MISP core format, MISP object template format, MISP taxonomy format and MISP galaxy format) are now published.

Many proprietary and open source software are implementing and using the MISP standard in their respective software such as the [MISP Project](https://www.misp-project.org/), [The Hive](https://thehive-project.org/), [AIL Framework](https://github.com/CIRCL/AIL-framework), [PyMISP](https://github.com/MISP/PyMISP) and many more.
