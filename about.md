MISP standard is a collaborative intelligence standard powering intelligence and information exchange, sharing and modeling. The misp-standard.org is a standard body developing free and open standards through sane open source collaboration.

# History

In 2012, a group of organisations started to work on an open source project to exchange cybersecurity information called [MISP](https://www.misp-project.org/). Over the years,
the project became larger and different organisations started to use it and contribute. The team behind the open source project started to document the formats and protocols used in MISP. More users, contributors and organisations started to rely on the MISP formats and protocols for information and intelligence exchange. In 2017, the MISP format was extended with the object templating. Object templating introduced the ability for anyone to control their own custom data-models without depending of third-party validation or consensus. In 2019, the MISP project spin off a new structure to standardise the format under the [misp-standard.org](https://www.misp-standard.org).
