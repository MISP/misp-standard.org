MISP standard is a collaborative intelligence standard, powering intelligence and information exchange, sharing and modeling. The misp-standard.org is a standard body developing free and open standards through sane open-source collaboration.

# History

In 2012, a group of organisations joined forces in order to work on an open-source project, aiming to enable the exchange of cybersecurity information, called [MISP](https://www.misp-project.org/). Over the years,
the project grew larger and a wide range of organisations became both users of and contributors to the project. The team behind the open-source project started to document the formats and protocols used by the MISP software, which lead to more users, contributors and organisations starting to rely on the MISP formats and protocols for information and intelligence exchange. In 2017, the MISP format was extended with an object templating system, introducing the ability for anyone to control their own custom data-models without depending on third-party validation or consensus. In 2019, the MISP project spun off a new structure to standardise the format under the [misp-standard.org](https://www.misp-standard.org).
